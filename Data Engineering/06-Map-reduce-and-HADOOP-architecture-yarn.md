# Map Reduce and HADOOP ARCHITECTURE YARN (06)


# =>  How Spotify Works – Hadoop Processing & YARN 

---
 YARN is Hadoop’s resource management layer that dynamically allocates CPU and memory across distributed jobs using Resource Managers, Application Masters, and containers.


##  Big Picture: How Spotify Optimizes Listening Experience

Spotify has **2B+ users** streaming music simultaneously.  
To make this possible, Spotify relies on **Big Data systems** to:

- Store massive audio & metadata
- Process user behavior (likes, skips, repeats)
- Allocate computing resources efficiently

At a high level, Hadoop provides **three core layers**:

```

Storage  → HDFS
Processing → MapReduce
Resource Management → YARN

```

📌 **HDFS** was covered earlier  
📌 In this session, focus is on **Processing & YARN**

##  Hadoop Architecture (Revisited)

| Layer | Responsibility |
|----|---------------|
| HDFS | Distributed storage |
| MapReduce | Data processing |
| YARN | Resource & job management |

---

##  Rack Awareness (Very Important Concept)

A **rack** is a collection of DataNodes connected to the same network switch.

### Rack Awareness Rule:
> **Replicas of the same block must never be stored on the same rack**

### Why?
- If a rack fails (power / switch / fire)
- All nodes in that rack go down
- Data loss occurs if replicas were colocated

 HDFS ensures:
- Replicas across **different DataNodes**
- Replicas across **different racks**
- Sometimes across **different regions**

---

##  How HDFS Reads a File (Optimized for Speed)

### Step-by-step File Read Flow

1️⃣ A file is split into **128 MB blocks**  
2️⃣ Each block has **3 replicas** on different DataNodes  
3️⃣ Client requests the file from **NameNode**  

---

### Step 1: Metadata Lookup

NameNode returns a **block-to-DataNode mapping**, e.g.:

```

Block 1 → DN1, DN2, DN10
Block 2 → DN12, DN4, DN11
...

```

 NameNode only provides **locations**, not data.

---

### Step 2: Latency-Based Selection

Each block has multiple replicas.  
The client chooses the **nearest DataNode** based on **network latency**.

Example:
```

Block 1 replicas:
DN1 → 2 ms
DN2 → 10 ms
DN10 → 30 ms

```

✅ DN1 is selected (lowest latency)

---

### Step 3: Parallel Block Reading

If a file has **10 blocks**:
- Each block is read **in parallel**
- From the closest DataNode
- Blocks are then **concatenated**

 This parallelism makes HDFS **very fast for large files**

---

##  Processing Layer – MapReduce

MapReduce is the **processing engine** in Hadoop.

### What does MapReduce do?
- Processes data stored in HDFS
- Works in **parallel**
- Moves computation **to data**, not data to computation

### Two Phases:
1️⃣ **Map** → Process input blocks  
2️⃣ **Reduce** → Aggregate results  

 Example use cases:
- Counting song plays
- Aggregating user listening time
- Building recommendation models




#  Why Resource Management is Needed (YARN – Deep & Intuitive)

---

##  The Core Problem Hadoop Faced

In a Hadoop cluster:
- There are **hundreds or thousands of machines**
- Each machine has:
  - CPU
  - RAM
  - Disk
- Many users submit jobs **at the same time**

### The big questions:
- Which job should run first?
- Which machine should run which task?
- How much CPU & RAM should each job get?
- What happens if something fails?

 This entire problem is called **Resource Management**

---

##  Real-Life Analogy (Intuitive Explanation)

### Imagine a company

- The company has **multiple teams**
- Each team has:
  - A manager
  - Several employees
- Some employees are working
- Some employees are on bench

Now a **new project** arrives:
- Needs **2 employees**
- Can be done by *any* employee in the company

---

### ❌ Bad System (Without Central Resource Management)

Rules:
- A project can only take employees from **one team**

Situation:
- Team 1 → 1 employee free
- Team 2 → 1 employee free
- Team 3 → 0 employees free

Result:
- ❌ Project is rejected
- ❌ Even though **2 employees are available globally**

This leads to **wasted resources**.

---

### ✅ Good System (With Central Resource Management)

Now imagine a **central HR group**:
- Knows which employees are free
- Looks across **all teams**
- Assigns:
  - 1 employee from Team 1
  - 1 employee from Team 2

Result:
- ✅ Project runs
- ✅ Resources are fully utilized
- ✅ No artificial team restriction

 **This central HR group is exactly what YARN is**

---

##  What is YARN?

**YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)** is the **resource management layer of Hadoop**.

> HDFS stores data  
> MapReduce processes data  
> **YARN decides who gets CPU & RAM**

---

##  What Does YARN Actually Manage?

YARN manages **resources**, not data.

### Resources include:
- CPU cores
- RAM (memory)

YARN answers:
- Which job runs?
- Where does it run?
- How much CPU/RAM does it get?
- What happens on failure?

---

##  YARN Core Components (Basic Mental Model)

---

###  Resource Manager (RM) – The Brain

Think of RM as:
> **Company HR Head**

Responsibilities:
- Knows total cluster resources
- Knows all running jobs
- Decides how resources are distributed

 RM **does not execute tasks**

---

###  Node Manager (NM) – The Local Manager

Runs on **every machine**.

Think of NM as:
> **Team Manager**

Responsibilities:
- Manages local CPU & RAM
- Reports resource availability to RM
- Launches containers
- Monitors tasks
- Kills tasks if limits are exceeded

 One cluster has:
- 1 Resource Manager
- Many Node Managers

---

###  Containers – The Resource Box

A **container** is:
> A bundle of resources assigned to a task

Example:
```text
Container = 4 GB RAM + 2 CPU cores
````

Important points:

* Container ≠ VM
* Container ≠ Docker
* Container = **resource limit**
* One container runs **one task**
* Tasks are isolated from each other

---

##  Problem with the Old Architecture

Earlier:

* Resource Manager directly handled tasks
* If a task exceeded its resource limit:

  * ❌ Container was killed
  * ❌ Job failed
  * ❌ Computation was wasted

This approach was **rigid and inefficient**.

---

##  New YARN Architecture (Modern & Important)

To solve these issues, Hadoop introduced the **Application Master**.

---

###  Architecture Overview

```text
Resource Manager (Global)
        ↓
Application Master (Per Job)
        ↓
Containers (Tasks)
```

---

##  Application Master (AM) – The Game Changer

Each job gets its **own Application Master**.

Think of AM as:

> **Project Manager**

---

### Responsibilities of Application Master

1️⃣ Understands job logic
2️⃣ Splits job into tasks
3️⃣ Requests containers from RM
4️⃣ Assigns tasks to containers
5️⃣ Monitors execution
6️⃣ Handles failures

 RM understands the **cluster**
 AM understands the **job**

---

##  Old vs New Architecture (Very Important)

| Old System           | New System             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| RM managed tasks     | AM manages tasks       |
| Static allocation    | Dynamic allocation     |
| Kill on limit exceed | Request more resources |
| Less flexible        | Highly flexible        |

---

##  Example: Dynamic Resource Allocation

### Job Requirement

```text
40 GB RAM
10 CPU cores
```

### Available Resources

| Node   | Free RAM | Free CPU |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| Node A | 10 GB    | 4 cores  |
| Node B | 20 GB    | 4 cores  |
| Node C | 10 GB    | 2 cores  |

---

### What Happens Internally

1️⃣ RM checks total available resources
2️⃣ RM allocates resources across nodes
3️⃣ AM splits the job into **3 parallel tasks**
4️⃣ Each task runs in its own container

Result:

* ✅ Parallel execution
* ✅ Better utilization
* ✅ Faster completion
* ✅ Fault tolerance

---

##  Why Scheduling is Required

When:

* Many jobs are submitted
* Resources are limited

YARN needs rules to decide:

* Who runs first?
* Who waits?
* Who gets more resources?

---

##  Scheduling in YARN (Simple Explanation)

---

### 1️⃣ Fair Scheduler

Idea:

> Everyone gets a fair chance

* Resources shared equally
* No job starvation
* When one job finishes, others get more

Best for:

* Shared clusters
* Research & analytics teams

---

### 2️⃣ Capacity Scheduler

Idea:

> Department-wise quotas

* Cluster divided into queues
* Each queue has guaranteed capacity

Example:

```text
Finance → 40%
Marketing → 30%
ML Team → 30%
```

* One team cannot starve others
* Common in large enterprises
